## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm Nik, a Software engineer based in San Diego.

## A Little About Me
Python is my typical language of choice. I build full stack web applications and always strive to improve my knowledge by building cool projects.
When I'm not coding, I am spending my time lifting or watching the latest movies in theatres.
