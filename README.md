## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm Nik, a Software engineer based in San Diego.

## A Little About Me
Python is my typical language of choice. I build full stack web applications and always strive to improve my knowledge by building cool projects.
When I'm not coding, I am spending my time lifting or watching the latest movies in theatres.

 
## My Projects 

<!-- 1. <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/ashryan/BitTracker>BitTracker</a> - A Crypto Currency portfolio tracker built using React, Firebase and the Coin Gecko API

### All projects should containing a readme explaining, 
1. What the project does
2. Requirements
3. How to use it, installation steps etc
4. Technologies used
5. Considerations you had to make (how you approached the project)
6. All this should be backed up by screenshots

Here's an example project readme - [Example ReadMe](https://github.com/nology-tech/Example-RM)
