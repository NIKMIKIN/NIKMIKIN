## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm Nik, a Software engineer based in San Diego. Soon to be Junior Test Engineer at ASML

## A Little About Me

I've been programming since 2018, but fully putting my all into my software engineering journey this past year and a half. I love working with Python specifically, but have also worked with languages such as C++, Javascript, Java, HTML, and CSS. Before programming I was really into music and performed as a percussionist for a few years. I love to build web applications and always strive to improve my knowledge by building cool projects (front-end/back-end). When I'm not coding, I am spending my time hitting the gym or watching the latest movies in theatres.
